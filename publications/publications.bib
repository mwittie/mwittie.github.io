This framework speeds up the research and development spirals, provides faster feedback to algorithm developers and closes the loop between theory and qualitative analysis of the protocols' performance. Rapid prototyping and evaluation of proposed algorithms is performed in the MATLAB environment. These tools enable us to numerically analyze performance, capabilities, convergence, and robustness of new algorithms. The second higher fidelity approach is the test and evaluation framework developed in OPNET simulation environment. Its unique features are the novel application and evaluation process including sophisticated statistics collection and an event logging architecture.},
